Machine Learning Project: Insurance Purchase Prediction
Project Overview: Developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of insurance purchases based on demographic factorsâ€”specifically age and income. This project aimed to assist insurance companies in targeting potential customers more effectively.

Data Collection and Preparation: Gathered a dataset containing 400 entries with features including age, estimated salary, and purchase status (0 for no purchase, 1 for purchase). Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values and normalize features using StandardScaler.

Model Selection and Implementation:

Implemented Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms using Python's Scikit-learn library.
Split the dataset into training and test sets (75% training, 25% testing) to train and evaluate each model.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Trained each model on the training data and evaluated their performance using accuracy metrics.
Compared model performance using confusion matrices to assess true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Results and Insights:

Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 85.4%, while SVM reached 87.2%, indicating robust predictive capabilities.
Decision Tree and Random Forest models provided insights into feature importance, highlighting income as a significant predictor of insurance purchase behavior.
Visualization and Interpretation:

Visualized model results using Matplotlib to illustrate the distribution of predicted vs. actual insurance purchases.
Presented findings to stakeholders, emphasizing actionable insights for marketing and sales strategies based on demographic profiling.
Skills Demonstrated:

Applied proficiency in Python programming, data preprocessing, and machine learning algorithms.
Demonstrated analytical skills in data exploration, model selection, and performance evaluation.
Communicated technical findings effectively to non-technical stakeholders, showcasing the ability to derive business value from data-driven insights.
Future Directions:

Planned enhancements include incorporating additional demographic and behavioral variables to improve model accuracy and robustness.
Explored deployment options for integrating the predictive model into real-time business applications to enhance decision-making processes.
