Machine Learning Project: Insurance Purchase Prediction
Project Overview: Developed a machine learning model to predict insurance purchase likelihood based on demographic factorsâ€”specifically age and income. This project aimed to optimize customer targeting strategies for insurance companies.

Data Collection and Preparation: Curated a dataset comprising 400 entries with features including age, estimated salary, and purchase status (0 for no purchase, 1 for purchase). Conducted data cleaning, handled missing values, and standardized features using StandardScaler.

Model Selection and Implementation:

Implemented and evaluated several machine learning algorithms using Python's Scikit-learn library:
Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 89%, providing baseline performance.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) delivered superior performance with 93% accuracy, leveraging proximity-based classification.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved an accuracy of 90%, demonstrating robust classification capabilities.
Decision Tree and Random Forest models both achieved 91% accuracy, offering insights into feature importance and ensemble learning benefits.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Partitioned the dataset into training (75%) and test sets (25%) to train models and assess performance metrics.
Employed confusion matrices to evaluate true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each model.
Results and Insights:

Identified income as a critical predictor of insurance purchase behavior across all models.
Visualized model predictions using Matplotlib to illustrate the distribution of predicted vs. actual outcomes, facilitating stakeholder comprehension.
Skills Demonstrated:

Applied advanced proficiency in Python programming, machine learning algorithms, and data preprocessing techniques.
Demonstrated analytical prowess in model selection, performance evaluation, and interpretation of results.
Communicated technical findings effectively to stakeholders, translating complex data insights into actionable business strategies.
Future Directions:

Planned enhancements include integrating additional demographic and behavioral variables to enhance model accuracy and robustness.
Explored deployment options for real-time application of predictive models, optimizing decision-making processes in insurance marketing and sales.
